# Crypto guess app

This is a project built with React + TypeScript + Vite.
It uses ESLint and Prettier rules and vitest + testing library + msw for testing.

## Description

Crypto Guess is a simple and interactive web application where players predict whether the **price of Bitcoin (BTC/USD)** will go up or down in the next minute. The game combines real-time cryptocurrency market data with a fun and competitive scoring system.

Players identify themselves with a **unique username**, which allows them to keep track of their progress.  
If a user leaves the page and comes back later, the application restores the state of their **active bet**, so they can seamlessly continue where they left off.

When a bet is resolved, the player is immediately **notified of the points gained or lost**, making the experience dynamic and engaging.

Additionally, the app features a dedicated **statistics page** where players can review detailed insights into their betting history, including outcomes and performance trends, helping them analyze and improve their prediction strategies.

## Notes

### Crypto BTC price:
- For this prototype, the Bitcoin price is fetched using **polling** instead of a real-time **stream**.
- The ideal implementation should use a backend service that connects to a real-time stream of BTC prices and relays updates to the frontend.
- Since there were issues running the stream locally, it was replaced with polling to keep the project simple and functional for testing purposes.

### Testing
We have implemented both unit and integration tests, though not for the entire codebase. The project includes a solid set of examples that demonstrate how we approach testing in different areas, such as:

- UX components
- General components
- TypeScript utility functions
- Logic within custom hooks
- Complete features (integration tests)
